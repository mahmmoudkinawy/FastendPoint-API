## Faster API than regular MVC and Minimal APIs.
### <a href="https://fast-endpoints.com/">Fastend point</a> API with support for Validation and Swagger documention.

### - Example for getting all products which seeded by <a href="https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus">Bogus</a> package!

### - Note: <a href="https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus">Bogus</a> is a package for seeding data!

## To run this API:-

    1 - clone the project
    2 - dotnet restore .
    3 - dotnet run or from run button!

### Note: you don't need to write command:-

    dotnet ef database update

because I already did a configuration that will apply and pending migrations and will seed the data as soon as you run the API.

### Used Technologies and tools!

    1 - Asp.net core 6.0
    2 - PostgreSQL
